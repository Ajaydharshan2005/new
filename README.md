Project Title
"Chaotic Writing Leaderboard: Crowning the Masters of Messy Handwriting"

Project Overview
This project aims to rank the most chaotic handwriting in a classroom through a user-driven leaderboard. Students can upload images of their handwriting, which are then analyzed and rated for "chaos" levels based on criteria like illegibility, randomness of letter sizes, and inconsistency in alignment. The goal is to gamify messy handwriting, making it a fun and humorous activity while demonstrating skills in data processing, user interaction, and rankings.

Key Features
Handwriting Upload System: Users can upload images of their handwriting via a web interface.
AI Handwriting Analysis: A model scores handwriting on a "chaos scale," including factors like illegibility, inconsistency, and randomness.
Leaderboard: Displays the top "chaotic writers" with scores and user names.
Voting System: Allows users to upvote or downvote handwriting samples to add a social element.
Filters: View leaderboard based on categories like "most chaotic letters," "sloppiest alignment," etc.
User Profiles: Each user has a profile to track their uploaded handwriting and scores.
Shareable Results: Users can share their rankings on social media with fun, autogenerated captions.
Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js (for a responsive and interactive UI)
Tailwind CSS (for styling)
Backend:

Node.js with Express.js (to handle server-side logic)
Python (for handwriting analysis with image processing libraries like OpenCV and Tesseract)
Database:

MongoDB (to store user data, images, and scores)
Other Tools:

Cloudinary (for image uploads and storage)
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for handwriting analysis using a pre-trained or fine-tuned model)
GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
Why This Project
This project stands out because of its blend of humor, user engagement, and technical complexity. Itâ€™s fun and relatable for students but also involves working with:

Image Processing: Extract and analyze handwriting from uploaded images.
AI/ML: Develop or utilize a model to assess handwriting chaos quantitatively.
Gamification: Build an engaging leaderboard to keep users entertained.
Frontend/Backend Development: Full-stack project experience involving real-time interactivity.
